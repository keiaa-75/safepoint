# Security Policy

The project maintainer(s) take security bugs in SafePoint seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please do not open a public issue. Instead, please use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/keiaa-75/safepoint/security/advisories/new) to privately report the issue.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- The potential impact (if known)
- Any suggested mitigations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days and will keep you informed about the progress of your report.

## Scope

This policy applies to all code in the main branch of the repository. As the project is currently in beta and not yet publicly released, only the latest development version is supported.

At this time, security patches are no backported to older versions or branches.

## Observed security practices

To help maintain code quality ad reduce known risks, this project uses:

- GitHub Dependabot for dependency vulnerability alerts
- CodeQL for static code analysis and vulnerability detection

These tools help catch common issues early, but they are not a substitute for thorough security review.

## Data privacy and compliance

This project is developed with awareness of the Philippine Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173). While the app does not currently process sensitive personal information in its beta phase, future public releases will adhere to applicable data protection principles, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and user rights.

## Public disclosure

Please allow a reasonable time for issues to be addressed before disclosing them publicly. Coordinated disclosure helps protect users and maintains trust in the open-source ecosystem.
